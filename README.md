Create an application similar to Twitter. DO NOT BUILD A USER INTERFACE, just a backend exposing a well-formed API. 

### Basic Functionality (required)* 

- User registration using unique username and a password
- User login (Including session maintenance using any means you’re comfortable with)

### Extended Functionality

Start *only* once the Basic Functionality is complete. Complete these *in the order specified** 

- Follow, unfollow
- Create, read, delete tweet (Twitter doesn’t support update, you won’t need to either.)


### Extra Credit

- Like/unlike a tweet
